# LinkedIn Conversion API Tag for Google Tag Manager (server-side)

The LinkedIn Conversion API Tag allows advertisers to send web events from their servers directly to the Conversions API.

## Background

The LinkedIn Conversion API (CAPI) is essential for overcoming the limitations of the Insight Tag, which has become less effective due to ad blockers and the decline of third-party cookies (on browsers like Safari and Firefox). While the Insight Tag uses client-side tracking with third-party cookies, the LinkedIn Conversion API relies on server-side tracking. Using both methods together ensures optimized and reliable data collection across all browsers.

## How does the Addingwell tag work?

This template is a tag that reads the standard event schema sent from the client running on a tagging server. It then converts events to the appropriate schema and sends them through the Conversions API.

The tag supports only GA4 client.
